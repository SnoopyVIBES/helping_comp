        <h5>So how this works is every person that enrolls can't quit until next year. This is taken really seriously. Each person will be formed into groups and will
            be sent into diffrent places. We do this by additude. f somone is really cheery, there sent to newyork to clean That means, they will get alot of point and will get lots of prizes. All fees are payed by us. But if someone doesnt 
            wanna be here, they'll be sent to a easier place to clean and get fewer points for prizes. This will be happening 8:00am SHARP to 8:00pm end. To keep you entertained,
            weve bought lots of stuff for you and some money for you to buy. This included foods, gadgets, souveniers, trinkets, but NO PLASTIC.
